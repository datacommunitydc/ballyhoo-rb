_Making Meetup Event Announcements Fast and Useful!_

    noun \ˈba-lē-ˌhü\

* a noisy attention-getting demonstration or talk
* flamboyant, exaggerated, or sensational promotion or publicity
* excited commotion


Does your Meetup event get bogged down by people announcing jobs, events, and other things? Do people announce amazing
opportunities, then disappear before actual connections are made? Then Ballyhoo is for you! Here's how it works:

1. Users log into Ballyhoo with their Meetup credentials -- Ballyhoo securely authenticates users, automatically retreiving what Meetups they're members of, and organizers for.
2. Users create announcements _before_ the event, listing their name, a URL, and a text announcement. 
3. During the event, as people make announcements aloud, an event organizer can promote queued announcements to make them visible. Visible announcements can be projected onto a big screen for users to see. Updates happen in real time!
4. Announcements have the name, URL, and text, plus a photo of the announcer. It's easy to follow up now!
5. Announcements can be archived after an event, then re-queued by the announcer for the next event.

Ballyhoo is a collaboration of the [DC Ruby Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/) and [Data Community DC](http://datacommunitydc.org). Design and coding are led by Josh Szmajda (DCRUG) and Harlan Harris (DC2).
